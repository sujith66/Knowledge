Web has different design patterns . Listing 3 most important patterns below.

1. creational design pattern - Provides structure to create objects , provides flexibility on its creation and reuse existing code .

Eg: Singelton - a creational design pattern where it restricts the class to have only one instance, while also creating global access point to the instance. It is used when we require a control access to shared resources.

use this pattern when control access is required for resource that might return inconsistencies if it is changed by two different objects. for eg: databases or state of an object

2. Structural design pattern - provides a structure that helps assemble classes and objects to larger structures.

eg: Decorators - a structural pattern that lets you add new characteristics to the objects by adding a wrapper that contains the behaviours 3. bevioural patterns - design pattern that assign responsibilities between objects and take care of communication

eg: Observer - a pattern in which objects gets information about any events happening to the objects they are observing. the observer pattern defines a subscribe method where it updates all the objects that are subscribed to itself making sure every subscriber gets the latest update. Eg: newsletter - when someone is added to the mail list, they get updates everytime some new publication comes up.
