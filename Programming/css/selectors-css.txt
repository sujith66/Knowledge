CSS Selectors

Universal selector (*)

Selects everything except before and after pseudo elements.for eg

* , *::before, *::after {
box-sizing: border-box;
margin-top: 10px;
}

This is a block that will be written at the start of css stylesheet for overriding the above default properties for all the css elements

Children selectors

div p {
color: red;
}

the block selects all the p inside the div block even the elements which are grandchildren to the div.

div > p{
color: red
}

the block will only select the p elements that are direct children to the div. If there is a nested div and have P element inside, the above selector wont select the p element inside it.

Adjacent Selectors

-Adjacent selectors ( div + p) Selects the adjacent selectors for p ie, it checks for divs before p's

for eg: 

<div class="adjacent-siblings">
<p class="box"></p>
<p class="box"></p>
<a>hello</a>
<p class="box"></p>
<p class="box"></p>
</div>

.adjacent-siblings .box + .box {
background-color: red;
}

this will give red color to all the boxes except the first one as it does not have an element with .box class before. In case where the a is added in the middle, the box after a wont be selected red as it does not have an adjacent element with .box class before it.

- General siblings

General selectors ( div ~ p) Similar to adjacent selectors ,this selects the adjacent selectors for p ie, it checks for divs before p's but the difference is when the a tag comes in.  The box after the a will be selected red as it checks for any element before it with .box class. for eg:

<div class="general-siblings">
<p class="box"></p>
<p class="box"></p>
<a>hello</a>
<p class="box"></p>
<p class="box"></p>
</div>

.general-siblings .box ~ .box {
background-color: red;
} 
All the elements with .box will be red .

Attribute selectors
